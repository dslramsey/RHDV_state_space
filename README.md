## Getting started

**File descriptions**:

*R/.* – R code used to process the spotlight and seroprevalence data and
fit Stan models.

*Data/.* – Contains csv files for the rabbit spotlight and serology
datasets.

*Stan/.* – Stan code for the rabbit N-mixture state-space model as well
as the MAR(1) model fitted to the seroprevalence data for the three
strains.

## Prerequisites

The R scripts require packages *tidyverse*, *lubridate*, *gridExtra*,
*rstan* and *MCMCvis*.
